# discord-command-debugger
when a error comes while having a error this thing will change a 10 line error to a 1 line error 

add this to the first line of any discord bot 

this will send the error on the same place where u used the command (will delete after 30 seconds) + on console, it will also make the code easier to read.

some errors wont show if u have the first one added if u add the v2 one it will only send errors when, command not found, missing args, missing premission
